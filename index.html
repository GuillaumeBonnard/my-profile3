                <p>My name is Guillaume Bonnard, I am 23 years old and currently pursuing a Bachelor degree in 
                    Hospitality Management at EHL Hospitality Business School, which I will be graduating from in 
                    February 2023

             <p>I spent over a year and half in the Swiss 
                army in which I chose to rank up and became an Officer. A position where I was given the responsibility 
                to lead the formation and education of a unit composed of 40 soldiers and 5 sergeants. Additionally, I 
                was then promoted to vice-company commandant which encompassed supervising a unit of 200 
                people. This experience not only allowed me to develop resilience, but also enrich both my
                organizational and leadership skills, which have been of great use when it comes to my other ventures.</p>
